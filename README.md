## Neural Network Model Report for Alphabet Soup

# Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to develop a binary classification model to predict whether an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful. This involves data preprocessing, building and training a deep learning model, and optimizing the model to achieve a target accuracy of 75%.

# Results
Data Preprocessing
- Target Variable: IS_SUCCESSFUL
- Feature Variables: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT
- Removed Variables: EIN, NAME

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions:
- Neurons: Initial model - 80, 30; Optimized model - 80, 30, 20
- Layers: Initial model - 2 hidden layers; Optimized model - 3 hidden layers
- Activation Functions: ReLU for hidden layers, sigmoid for output; optimized with ELU and tanh

Model Performance:
- Initial model accuracy: Below 75%
- Optimized model accuracy: Over 75%
Steps to Increase Performance:
- Added additional hidden layers and neurons
- Experimented with different activation functions (e.g., ELU, tanh)
- Adjusted the number of epochs

Summary
The optimized model achieved an accuracy of over 75%, using a combination of ReLU and ELU activation functions in the hidden layers.

Recommendation for a Different Model
Further optimization can be achieved by experimenting with different combinations of activation functions, epoch numbers, and layers. Additionally, ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting could be considered for better performance and interpretability.
